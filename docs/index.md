# Introduction

!!! abstract "This site contains basic notes in Hybrid Cloud Technology."


Welcome to this module, Hybrid Cloud Technology (HCT). I plan and orchestrate my modules with 10 weeks of content, weeks 2-11.

I reserve week 1 for introductions and getting started.

I reserve week 12/13 for clean up at the end...or run over time if we need it.

This module is intended for students who already have some background in scripting and automation, networking and operating systems. It is assumed you already have an undergraduate degree in computing or a similar discipline. The material is thus pitched at people who can self-learn. The content and structure of this module was created c. 2015 and it is updated annually. 

If you are doing this module remotely, you need a good modern computer, review my notes in Week 1 to understand what you need.
