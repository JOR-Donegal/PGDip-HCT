This GIT account hosts my teaching notes. 

I have been writing course content since the last millenium (sad but true!). Changing platforms has been the bane of my life. Moving my documents to an open format and to a technology that I can sync and save seems to be a good idea. And using a static site generator leaves me independent of any changes that come along to services in the future.

After two years of experimentation, this is a new dedicated teaching account as of mid-2025.

Retirement is hopefully not too far away! I want the notes in this repo to be available to my students after I retire, this is one way to do so.

Contact me via my University e-mail address or via my LinkedIn account.
