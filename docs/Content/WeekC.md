# Week 3
This week  we need to look at all those components which we need to make a small, enterprise data centre. 
These concepts scale up, we can apply them to large data centres and even to cloud-scale data centres.
I assumme you are already competent with VMWare Workstation, if not, bring this to the attention of your lecturer now.

We need to examine with desktop hyper visor which ships with Windows, Hyper-V. Do NOT install this on your host comp[uter, we will use it in a VM only as nested virtualization.

## Actions
1. Read through my notes on [data centre design considerations and layout](https://johnoraw.gitbook.io/data-centres-1/)
2. Go through the exercises in my [notes on Hyper V](https://johnoraw.gitbook.io/desktop-virtualization-in-hyper-v-1/).
