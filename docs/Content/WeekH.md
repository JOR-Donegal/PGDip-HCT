# Week 8
Another week, another hypervisor! This week we are going to cover another hypervisor which has become very popular as a replacement for VMWare. Proxmox is based on Linux and we can cover some useful technology on a very modest host running under VMWare workstation. Some of the technology I introduce here (ZFS, Ceph) is very significant.
