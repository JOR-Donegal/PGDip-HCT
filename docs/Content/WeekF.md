# Week 6
In the early part of our courses, desktop virtualization is done using 

- VMware Workstation
- Microsoft Hyper-V

In these notes, I am looking at VMWare ESXi technology and we refer to these technologies as Virtual Machine Managers (VMMs). 

For students who do not do a Storage module with me, I also have some background study in storage reliability for you to do.
