The most common Authentication, Authorization and Accounting (AAA) infrastructure we find in modern enterprise and data centres is Microsoft's Active Directory (AD).

This week we are going to work on some of the theory and terminology behind having a local AD infrastructure.

In our practical work, I want to look at an alternative to VMWare, Microsoft's Hyper-V.
