# Week 4
When I started building computer rooms and data centres in the late 1980s, they were based on minicomputer/mainframe type technology. In many ways, they were far simpler and smaller than a modern data centre. However, many of the characteristics were those we can still find in a modern data centre. In this week's theory, I want to cover some of the basic technical areas with which we need familiarity.

In our practical work, you need to cover some basic skills in VMWare Workstation. If you have covered this with me in a previous module, I will give you some alternate work during class.
