# Week 9
Containers revolutionized software development by providing a lightweight, efficient, and portable solution for packaging applications and their dependencies, running under a single operating system kernel. They are thus more lightweight than Virtual Machines (VMs). VMs can also provide isolated, independent application environments, but they have considerable overhead compared to containers. This week we will examine some continer theory and practice, using Docker.
