Welcome to this module, Hybrid Cloud Technology (HCT). I plan and orchestrate my modules with 10 weeks of content, weeks 2-11. This iteration of the module was arranged for e-delivery for remote students. I reserve week 1 for introductions and getting started. The major areas covered in weeks 2-11 are Hardware Platforms Desktop Virtualization Server Virtualization Storage and Networking Virtualization I reserve week 12/13 for clean up at the end...or run over time if we need it. This module is intended for students who already have some background in scripting and automation, networking and operating systems. It is assumed you already have an undergraduate degree in computing or a similar discipline. The material is thus pitched at people who can self-learn. The content and structure of this module was created c. 2015 and last revised in 2022. It is updated annually. If you are doing this module remotely, you need a good modern computer, review my Getting Started notes 1 to understand what you need. Copyright The content of these notes are (c) John ORaw 2026. I have tried to acknowledge and cite sources, if you think I have missed crediting someone else's work, please contact me by university e-mail and I will remedy. If you find errors in my notes or something has been superseded without me noticing, please let me know. The pace of technological development assures that my notes have a very short shelf life. They are intended to be a starting point for your studies, not the end point.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"#introduction","text":"This site contains basic notes in Hybrid Cloud Technology.

Changing platforms has been the bane of my life. Moving my documents to an open format and to a technology that I can sync and save seems to be a good idea. And using a static site generator leaves me independent of any changes that come along to services in the future. After two years of experimentation, this is a new dedicated teaching account as of mid-2025. Retirement is hopefully not too far away! I want the notes to be available to my students after I retire, this is one way to do so.

Although you may have done the basics of this before, in these exercises we go into specifics. We need an understanding of server hardware, even when we are using public cloud (and do not have access to the hardware). In this weeks theory reading, I go through aspects of hardware that are important to us. It is worthwhile to supplement this information by looking at some commercial server providers to see what new paradigms have arisen since I wrote these notes. I also want to talk you through considerations when building an operating system, host, VM or device. In these notes, I am going to list some of the main things you need to do in every case, you are going to carry them out and verify! However, as with so many of my notes, this is guidance only. On a real project, find the best practice from the hardware vendor, the OS vendor, and the client, and create your own operating procedures to comply. In an Enterprise, what we will do here will only be the beginning. Security will be based on corporate policy and deployed centrally from a domain controller or similar. Discuss this with your lecturer. In any real enterprise or data centre, you as the technical person DO NOT MAKE THE DECISIONS ABOUT THESE THINGS!!!! Study Do some more reading on processors , this time on topics relating to server specification. Read through and understand my notes on OS Configuration . Practical Work Dig into the hardware of your personal system in some detail.","title":"Week 2"},{"location":"Content/WeekB/#week-2","text":"I want you to methodically verify your system in some technical detail to assess its suitability for desktop virtualization.

When I started building computer rooms and data centres in the late 1980s, they were based on minicomputer/mainframe type technology. In many ways, they were far simpler and smaller than a modern data centre. However, many of the characteristics were those we can still find in a modern data centre. In this week's theory, I want to cover some of the basic technical areas with which we need familiarity. These concepts scale up, we can apply them to large data centres and even to cloud-scale data centres. I assumme you are already competent with VMWare Workstation, if not, bring this to the attention of your lecturer now. We need to examine the desktop hypervisor which ships with Windows, Hyper-V. Do NOT install this on your host computer, we will use it in a VM only as nested virtualization.

It's useful for centralizing information in an SME, but it's essential for any infrastructure that needs to scale. Once the site goes beyond a trivial size, its security information becomes unmanageable unless we centralize it. This week we are going to work on some of the theory and terminology behind having a local AD infrastructure. In practical exercises this week, build the core services for a basic SME site using Active Directory. This should have two domain controllers, each having redundant AD, DNS, DHCP. One of the controllers should be set to synchronize time to a source of NTP. Plan the site as if it has no Internet connectivity. Study Read through my theory material on Active Directory Practical Work Build Authentication, Authorization and Accounting (AAA) infrastructure for an SME site, using scripts and configuration files where posible. Later study As public cloud emerged and became a viable platform for core services, many of us moved one of our domain controllers to public cloud. From a contingency and disaster recovery perspective, this was perfect; assuming you were confident about security. This developed into pure cloud-based applications, like Azure Active Directory . In previous notes, I have used the acronym Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA). You will also come across Identity and Access Management (IAM) used to describe these systems. Due to the pace of change in public cloud, I do not write notes for these topics, I point you in the direction and get you to do some background study. As a point in case, Azure Active Directory is now called Entra ID ! In your own time, do some background reading and after completion of the taught modules, use your Azure subscription to evaluate this.","title":"Week 4"},{"location":"Content/WeekD/#week-4","text":"The most common Authentication, Authorization and Accounting (AAA) infrastructure we find in modern enterprise and data centres is Microsoft's Active Directory (AD).
