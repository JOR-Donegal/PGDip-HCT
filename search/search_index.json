I plan and orchestrate my modules with 10 weeks of content, weeks 2-11. This iteration of the module was arranged for e-delivery for remote students.</p> <p>I reserve week 1 for introductions and getting started.</p> <p>I reserve week 12/13 for clean up at the end...or run over time if we need it.</p> <p>This module is intended for students who already have some background in scripting and automation, networking and operating systems. It is assumed you already have an undergraduate degree in computing or a similar discipline. The material is thus pitched at people who can self-learn. The content and structure of this module was created c. 2015 and it is updated annually. </p> <p>If you are doing this module remotely, you need a good modern computer, review my notes in Week 1 to understand what you need.</p>"},{"location":"#copyright","title":"Copyright","text":"<p>The content of these notes are (c) John ORaw 2025.</p> <p>I have tried to acknowledge and cite sources, if you think I have missed crediting someone else's work, please contact me by university e-mail and I will remedy.</p> <p>If you find errors in my notes or something has been superseded without me noticing, please let me know. The pace of technological development assures that my notes have a very short shelf life. They are intended to be a starting point for your studies, not the end point.</p>"},{"location":"about/","title":"About the author","text":"Yup, that is Mount St Helens and Coldwater lake. <p>This GIT account hosts my teaching notes. </p> <p>I have been writing course content since the last millenium (sad but true!). Changing platforms has been the bane of my life. Moving my documents to an open format and to a technology that I can sync and save seems to be a good idea. And using a static site generator leaves me independent of any changes that come along to services in the future.</p> <p>After two years of experimentation, this is a new dedicated teaching account as of mid-2025.</p> <p>Retirement is hopefully not too far away! I want the notes in this repo to be available to my students after I retire, this is one way to do so.</p> <p>Contact me via my University e-mail address or via my LinkedIn account.</p>"},{"location":"Content/WeekA/","title":"Week 1","text":"<p>Go through my Getting Started notes before doing anything else. These notes are the same for each module, so if you have gone through these on one of my previous modules, all good. There are no deliverables for this, it is not graded.</p> <p>In the teaching sessions this week, I get you started with a hypervisor and images.</p>"},{"location":"Content/WeekA/#computer-requirements","title":"Computer Requirements","text":"<p>You need to decide which type of device is most suitable for you. </p> <p>For distance education students who cannot access the campus, we are now recommending a desktop, not a laptop computer. This may also be the best solution for students who are doing modules in networking and virtualization and who need more memory than a laptop can cheaply provide. My practical exercises have been tested at a point in time and using conventional PC hardware. If you want to use any other desktop platform (Apple, Chrome Book, Linux), I cannot support it nor confirm that it will work. I have carried out all the practical exercises on a Dell Latitude 5580 from 2017 running Windows 10, with an i5 processor and 32 GB of DRAM. As I revalidate exercises, it is on a Dell 5520 from 2021 with Windows 11 32 GB of DRAM. </p> <p>In 2024 we discovered that older laptops may not run some virtualization software. If your laptop is &gt;3 years old, you may experience some issues.</p> <p>You may already have a home computer or laptop; it may not be suitable for this module. Check first to see if it meets the specifications discussed above. If you are using an existing home computer or laptop you need to make sure it is performing well, clean, fully patched and has anti-virus. If your computer is old or slow, full of games (!) or is used by other members of your family, it is NOT suitable for you to use for home study.</p> <p>If you have a laptop from your employer, it will not be suitable for this course. Most companies will lock down their operating systems with Group Policies. These prevent you from installing any software or having administrative privileges. My University laptop has security policies imposed that downgrade it to the functionality of a paperweight!  Even Hyper-V or VMWare Workstation do not work correctly.</p> <p>Although in the past, some people did manage to get through this programme of study using Apple hardware, with the move to the new processors (M1, M2, etc) in 2020, Apple hardware is not compatible with the requirements for practical exercises.</p>"},{"location":"Content/WeekA/#laptop","title":"Laptop","text":"<p>A laptop is disposable, buy cheaply and expect to get three years out of it, maximum, if you are lugging it around every day. Treating laptops kindly, they may however last for years (I do have a perfectly working Dell laptop from 2008!).</p> <p>Pick a processor which supports virtualization. Most modern processors do but check before purchase. Typically, students buy an i3 or i5 processor or the AMD equivalent.</p> <p>I am now recommending 32GB of main memory for all students.</p> <p>Every laptop has Wi-Fi and Bluetooth but check to be sure.</p> <p>For performance, buy a laptop with an SSD (1TB) and learn how to use the cloud to store your data. This is the preferred option as otherwise when your hard drive breaks (it will!) you will lose important work. Newer laptops may have two slots for NVMe SSDs. On my main laptop, my OS is on the original 500GB SSD and I added a 2TB SSD for Virtual Machines.</p> <p>Without that, you will need an external USB3 SSD drive for VMs and ISOs. </p> <p>Think of comfort! You should get a large monitor, keyboard, and mouse for working from home. Laptop ergonomics do not suit working for long periods of time. My laptop connects to external screens via a USB 3 docking station.</p> <p>Your laptop will come with Windows 11; that will be fine. You should not purchase additional software, as a registered student, you are entitled to MS Office and other software for free. We do NOT recommend buying commercial anti-virus software. Use the free version which comes with Windows 11. Make sure your computer is configured to download and install updates automatically. You may need to upgrade the version of Windows 11 on your laptop as the home version misses many important components. Again, this should be free, alternatively, buy your laptop with Windows 11, 64-bit, Professional.</p> <p>If you are doing a technical module or will work with networking, you will need a USB&lt;-&gt;RS232 serial adapter. These can be purchased inexpensively on-line.</p>"},{"location":"Content/WeekB/","title":"Week 2","text":"<p>This week I need you to read through some fundamentals of cloud computing, to deobfuscate and define some of the terminology we are going to use.</p> <p>I also want you to methodically verify your system in some technical detail to assess its suitability for desktop virtualization. Although you may have done the basics of this before, in these exercises we go into specifics.</p>"},{"location":"Content/WeekC/","title":"Week 3","text":"<p>We need an understanding of server hardware, even when we are using public cloud (and do not have access to the hardware). In this weeks theory reading, I go through aspects of hardware that are important to us. It is worthwhile to supplement this information by looking at some commercial server providers to see what new paradigms have arisen since I wrote these notes.</p> <p>I also want to talk you through considerations when building and operating system, host, VM or device. In these notes, I am going to list some of the main things you need to do in every case, you are going to carry them out and verify! However, as with so many of my notes, this is guidance only. On a real project, find the best practice from the hardware vendor, the OS vendor, and the client, and create your own operating procedures to comply. </p> <p>In an Enterprise, what we will do here will only be the beginning. Security will be based on corporate policy and deployed centrally from a domain controller or similar. Discuss this with your lecturer. In any real enterprise or data centre, you as the technical person DO NOT MAKE THE DECISIONS ABOUT THESE THINGS!!!!</p>"},{"location":"Content/WeekD/","title":"Week 4","text":"<p>When I started building computer rooms and data centres in the late 1980s, they were based on minicomputer/mainframe type technology. In many ways, they were far simpler and smaller than a modern data centre. However, many of the characteristics were those we can still find in a modern data centre. In this week's theory, I want to cover some of the basic technical areas with which we need familiarity.</p> <p>In our practical work, you need to cover some basic skills in VMWare Workstation. If you have covered this with me in a previous module, I will give you some alternate work during class.</p>"},{"location":"Content/WeekE/","title":"Week 5","text":"<p>The most common Authentication, Authorization and Accounting (AAA) infrastructure we find in modern enterprise and data centres is Microsoft's Active Directory (AD). It's useful for centralizing information in an SME, but it's essential for any infrastructure that needs to scale. Once the site goes beyond a trivial size, its security information becomes unmanageable unless we centralize it. This week we are going to work on some of the theory and terminology behind having a local AD infrastructure.</p> <p>In our practical work, I want to look at an alternative to VMWare, Microsoft's Hyper-V. </p>"},{"location":"Content/WeekF/","title":"Week 6","text":"<p>In the early part of our courses, desktop virtualization is done using </p> <ul> <li>VMware Workstation</li> <li>Microsoft Hyper-V</li> </ul> <p>In these notes, I am looking at VMWare ESXi technology and we refer to these technologies as Virtual Machine Managers (VMMs). </p> <p>For students who do not do a Storage module with me, I also have some background study in storage reliability for you to do.</p>"},{"location":"Content/WeekG/","title":"Week 7","text":"<p>You already have a good background in hypervisors and the associated terminology. This week we are going to look into Microsoft's Hyper-V.</p> <p>For students who do not do a Storage module with me, I also have some background study in storage technology for you to do.</p>"},{"location":"Content/WeekH/","title":"Week 8","text":"<p>Another week, another hypervisor! This week we are going to cover another hypervisor which has become very popular as a replacement for VMWare. Proxmox is based on Linux and we can cover some useful technology on a very modest host running under VMWare workstation. Some of the technology I introduce here (ZFS, Ceph) is very significant. </p>"},{"location":"Content/WeekI/","title":"Week 9","text":"<p>Containers revolutionized software development by providing a lightweight, efficient, and portable solution for packaging applications and their dependencies, running under a single operating system kernel. They are thus more lightweight than Virtual Machines (VMs). VMs can also provide isolated, independent application environments, but they have considerable overhead compared to containers. This week we will examine some continer theory and practice, using Docker.</p>"},{"location":"Content/WeekJ/","title":"Week 10","text":"<p>We need to understand the basics or business continuity and disaster recovery. We will cover this lightly, a full treatment of the subject is beyonbd what we have the time do do in this module.</p> <p>For students who do not do a Storage module with me, I also have some background study in availability calculations for you to do.</p>"},{"location":"Content/WeekK/","title":"Week 11","text":"<p>This is the last week of examinable content in this module. I am not a fan or writing course notes for cloud services, they change so rapidly and they (mostly!) include thier own tutorial notes. However, I have created AWS student accounts for you and registered you on at least one learning module. This week I am going to get you to cover the most common services we all use in AWS.</p>"}]}
